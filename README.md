### Project Description: 
The competitive landscape in today's business environment necessitates comprehensive and dynamic intelligence tools to empower analysts with actionable insights. In response to this need, our organization has developed an internal application, a robust competitive intelligence tool utilized by analysts across various departments. The application serves as a centralized repository housing detailed information on competitors, including their financial metrics, current status, and pertinent government documents and news articles. This wealth of data enables analysts to gain deep insights into the competitive landscape.

<b>Recommendation System Development:</b>

Leveraging the power of graph databases, particularly Neo4j, a recommendation system was developed. This system utilizes advanced algorithms to provide tailored recommendations, enabling analysts to effectively retrieve responses based on their search criteria.

<b>API Endpoint Development:</b>

An API endpoint has been developed to facilitate seamless integration with other tools and systems. This endpoint incorporates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Language Model (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), in context learning to effectively perform Question & Answer (Q&A) and document retrieval tasks. This enables analysts to interact with the application programmatically, enhancing workflow efficiency.

<b>Adoption Analytics Dashboards:</b>

To provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights into the adoption and utilization of the application, adoption analytics dashboards have been developed using Tableau. These dashboards offer visualizations and metrics, empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence on the tool's usage and impact.

### Project Description:
The New Employee Home Page represents a pivotal step in the organization's Digital Transformation journey, serving as a strategic tool to streamline employee experiences and enhance operational efficiency. As a comprehensive employee homepage hosted within the SAP Workzone framework, the site integrates essential functionalities such as a chatbot, search engine, pay details, benefits information, and other HR-related resources. This centralized platform empowers employees with easy access to critical information, thereby fostering productivity and engagement across the organization.

<b>Leadership in Data Analysis:</b>

Leading a team of data analysts, comprehensive insights have been derived to inform strategic decision-making throughout the project lifecycle. By leveraging data-driven approaches, opportunities for optimization and enhancement have been identified, ensuring the alignment of the team with organizational objectives.

<b>Web Analytics Utilization:</b>

Leveraging web analytics tools such as Dynatrace, in-depth analysis of user interactions and platform performance has been conducted. This ongoing monitoring and optimization process ensure that the application consistently delivers an exceptional user experience, driving user adoption and satisfaction.

<b>Tableau Dashboard Development:</b>

To provide stakeholders with actionable insights and performance metrics, Tableau dashboards have been developed. These dashboards offer visualizations of key performance indicators, enabling stakeholders to track the effectiveness and utilization of the tool across various metrics.

<b>User Feedback Analysis and NLP Tasks:</b>

Utilizing Qualtrics, user feedback has been systematically collected and analyzed to gauge user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, natural language processing (NLP) tasks have been performed on free-range text fields, enabling sentiment analysis and qualitative insights extraction to inform iterative enhancements.
